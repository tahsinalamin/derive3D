# derive3D


##Theme: Extract derivatives and gradients of multidimensional functions, and compare them.
Specifically, numerically calculate the directional derivative of a function A and compare it to another function
B.

##Description: Function A in 3D is a function A(x. y, z). First implement the code to calculate the partial
derivatives along the three axes (directional derivation) dA/dx, dA/dy and dA/dz. Then calculate the vector
dA/dr (r is the unit vector along axis X, Y, Z).

##Algorithm Input: function A(x,y)/A(x,y,z), B(x,y)/B(x,y,z), comapriason

##Algorithm Output: the derivatives of A(x,y)/A(x,y,z), comparison of the value of derivatives of A(x,y)/A(x,y,z) vs
B(x,y)/B(x,y,z) on each axis, comparison of the vector of derivatives A(x,y)/A(x,y,z) vs the vector defined by the
B(x,y)/B(x,y,z) function
